# UserScripts collection
This repository is a collection of user scripts that I find useful to help me achieve various things on the daily basis.

## How to use?
Get Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey extension for your browser. Then - just open any of the scripts and hopefully it'll be installed in your browser.
